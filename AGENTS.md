# Agent Guidelines

## Git Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for all commit messages:

**Format:**
- **Title only** - No body, no additional content
- **Imperative mood** - "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature"
- **Capitalize first letter** - "Fix bug" not "fix bug"
- **No period at end** - "Update docs" not "Update docs."
- **Under 50 characters** - Keep it concise and scannable

**Examples:**
- `Add user authentication`
- `Fix memory leak in worker pool`
- `Update dependencies to latest versions`

**Rationale:**
Short, imperative commits create a clean, scannable git history. Each commit should represent a single logical change that can be described in one concise line.

For more details, see README.md.
