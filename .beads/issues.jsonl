The repository has beads initialized with prefix `vibetree` but needs to finish onboarding and documentation setup.\n\n## Tasks\n\n### 1. Standardize Agent Instructions\n\nMove any Claude-specific instructions to `AGENTS.md` (the industry standard):\n- Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in the repo\n- If it exists, rename it to `AGENTS.md`\n- Create a symlink: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` for backwards compatibility\n- If neither exists, create `AGENTS.md` as a new file\n\n### 2. Run Beads Onboarding\n\nExecute the onboarding command and follow its instructions:\n\n```bash\nbd onboard\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Provide content to add to AGENTS.md about beads workflow\n- Give instructions for updating CLAUDE.md (if present)\n- Provide important reminders about beads usage\n\nFollow all the instructions provided by the onboarding command.\n\n### 3. Commit Beads Files\n\nAfter onboarding is complete, commit the beads initialization files:\n\n```bash\ngit add .beads/\ngit add AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md  # if applicable\ngit commit -m \"Initialize beads issue tracker with prefix vibetree\"\n```\n\n## Context\n\n- Beads was initialized with prefix: `vibetree`\n- Database: `.beads/beads.db`\n- Git hooks and merge driver already configured\n- The assistant repo has this repo configured as an additional repo for cross-repo issue visibility\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] AGENTS.md exists with beads documentation\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md symlink exists (if applicable)\n- [ ] `bd onboard` instructions completed\n- [ ] All beads files committed to git\n- [ ] Can run `bd list` and see issues","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-08T18:22:19.800531-10:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T18:30:19.27114-10:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T18:30:19.27114-10:00","source_repo":"."}
